Ibrahim's final
This is something that im probably going to use monthly because i am very passionate about fitness and health. I love to exercise and diet. Finding new exercises and healthy foods are a hobby of mine so making a calorie calculator was a very fun project for me.

This is my calorie calculator, I am using the Mifflin equation to calculate the resting metabolism rate. This is because the Mifflin equation is regarded as the most accurate equation.

At first i was satisfied with just having the user input their age weight and height but then i also figured that i would need to take their activity level in order to get a more accurate result.

I also want to add specific nutrients like proteins fats and carbs. I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to add in the activity level using the switch and case methods.

And at first I thought the equation was wrong because i didnt convert the  lbs into kilograms which threw the whole equation off.

Right now the methods run just how I want them to but im going to work on adding in those specific macros. i also was thinking of adding a plan that tracks how much calories and macros you could eat throughout the week so it wouldnt be strictly eating the same amount everyday. But this might be too hard to a method that would print a diet calendar for the week and i dont think i have enough time.
